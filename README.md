# 2024 Fall AI Application Hackathon

## Overview

Teams will participate in a Hackathon to advance an applied AI project of their choosing over the days of **10/7-10/20**.

## What is a Hackathon?

A Hackathon is a short period of intense and focused work to complete a project. The name is a portmanteau of “hack,” meaning to crudely shape or work, and “marathon,” a long race. The ambition of a hackathon is to put aside distractions and achieve something that might not otherwise be accomplished due to its ambitious nature or competing responsibilities. Hackathons have enabled many ideas to receive the attention they might not otherwise get.

## Project Statement

Teams should agree on a problem they wish to solve and how they aim to solve it. The project statement should describe a modest problem that is achievable in a few days. Teams are not expected to complete every part of their problem statement, but in the spirit of a hackathon, they should make significant progress. Projects are not required to be technical; in fact, non-technical projects are encouraged. Solve a problem leveraging what AI can help you achieve beyond current capabilities.

Two members of Paul English’s team will be available to help guide and shape project statements into achievable goals.

## Results

Teams will submit their results in the form of a working demo or “slide-ware.” Slide-ware is when the idea is thoroughly explored and presented but not built, ideal for projects that involve more technical work than can realistically be accomplished in the allotted time. Working demos are any tools that are usable to show the function of the team’s project.

## Team Size and Composition

Teams should consist of at least 2 and at most 8 members. We recommend teams around 6 or 7. Teams will often divide work into multiple skill sets, such as technical, design, communication, and business. While projects are not required to be technical, we encourage teams to seek out and include at least one technically experienced member to advise on state-of-the-art solutions.

## Judgement and Prizes

Teams will be judged by the Provost and Paul English on merit, innovation, execution, and creativity (TBD). Each winning team will be awarded **$1,000** and invited to present during the AI Symposium on **October 30th**.

### Example

Create an application that helps forecast UMB shuttle arrival times and how crowded it is.

## Guests from Paul’s Team

- Mike Burke (Expected to be unavailable after 10/18)
- Kate Tyshchenko (Willing to be in-person for part)

## Schedule

- **10/7**: Open registration for the Hackathon. Registration is not required for participation but will help us plan food and prizes.
  
- (Exact dates and times TBD. Propose **10/7, 10/8**): Days for Mike and Kate to give hybrid talks (Mike will be remote, and Kate may be available on campus) on how to successfully design a project for a Hackathon. Their primary talk will be on validation and scoping of projects.
  
- **10/7-10/20**: Noon AI Applications Hackathon.
  
  - On **Monday 10/7 – Noon**, we will have our kick-off event. Participants who are able will gather on campus to enjoy refreshments and talk with other participants. Some teams may overlap, merge, or reform; this is okay.
  
  - During the week, teams will work on their projects. Kate and Mike have volunteered to help mentor teams, especially with regard to their project scope and execution.
  
  - On **Sunday 10/20 Noon**, teams will submit their work for review. A closing ceremony will provide participants a chance to debrief, talk with others, and enjoy refreshments and participation prizes (e.g., t-shirts).
  
  - Team submissions will be given to the Provost and Paul English to judge.
  
- **10/27**: Winning teams will be notified and invited to talk at the AI Symposium.
  
- **10/30**: Prizes will be awarded and presentations given during the AI Symposium.

For each hybrid event (Mike and Kate’s talks, Kick-off, and Closing ceremonies), we will have A/V set up for all participants to see and hear each other. Conference room equipment will facilitate this.
